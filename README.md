# Data Updater
Go sources for binary, capable of updating schedule, substitution and menu data for Gimnazija Viƒç and writing it to MySql database, compatible with GimVic server app.

Usage: `./whateverYourBinaryNameIs [arg]` where arg could be sch (to update schedule), sub (to update substitutions) or menu (to update menu). When updating menu, csv source file must be provided as second argument. If all 3 args are provided, only the first one will be used.

`install.sh` script builds go binary and moves it to `/usr/bin/` under `gimvic-data-updater` name. It assumes that it has root permissions, go is installed and that you edited the scrpt's first line to match your `GOPATH`.
